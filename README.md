<a name="purpose"/>

## Purpose
APIOps Global Network is about building standardized API value chain automation - practices and tools included. We offer opportunities for developers to shine and get visibility for their skills and efforts in the area of API value chain automation. In addition we aim to share best practices among API economy community members and broader audience regardless of sector thus Youtube channel and live broadcasts from meetups. One of the aims is to speed up API economy and APIs- based services. Aim is to establish new local groups at least in 3 countries during 2017 and have at least 500 community members.    

<a name="structure"/>

## Structure 
Network consists of local meetup groups which are organized in meetup.com. Each location is independent and defines own details regarding events and co-operation with local partners. Focus on activities should nevertheless touch API value chain automation.

## Advisory board

APIOps Global network is managed by Jarkko Moilanen. Local group organizers are part of the advisory board ([members](https://github.com/APIOps/community-resources/blob/master/advisory-board-members.md)), which has monthly meetups online every first Monday of the month at 4pm (EET) to discuss network related issues and plans for future. Meeting room https://appear.in/apiops Advisory Board also includes 2-5 developers from the community to watch over and verify that developer focus is strong enough. 

Advisory board tasks and rights: 

* each organizer has 1 vote, but we aim for consensus rather than voting.  
* changes community guide lines
* decides how community's funds are used. Local groups control local funds. See [Community funding and partner packages](#communityfunding)
* forum for solving disputes and issues which can not be solved locally

<a name="guidelines"/>

## Community guidelines
[Our community guidelines](https://github.com/APIOps/community-resources/blob/master/apiops-community-guidelines.md) are maintained in separate file. Responsible body for changing the guidelines is [APIOps Advisory Board](#advisoryboard). 

<a name="rewardprogram"/>

## Reward program
Community speakers are given rewards for their efforts. The advisory board can also hand out additional rewards for active members in the community.  [Details for rewards](https://github.com/APIOps/community-resources/blob/master/resources-rewards.md) are defined and maintained in separate file.

<a name="activities"/>

## Activities and streaming

Community arranges **meetups in various locations**. Default period for having meetups is once a month, but local group can deviate from this if needed. Meetup presentations are broadcasted to Youtube and also saved for later use. [Instructions how to do Youtube broadcasting](https://github.com/APIOps/community-resources/blob/master/streaming.md) can be found from separate page. 

Presentations can discuss for example 

* developer stories about designing APIs, 
* implementing APIs, 
* automating a phase in API development or maintenance
* presentation can be pitch about API or APIs driven service. 
* monetization of APIs
* Open APIs ecosystem
* Community analytics
* API Developer eXperience
* Chatbots 
* ....

## Joint development model
In APIOps community we prefer to build win-win situations. Our default development model for services and software is mixed model which engages universities, companies and surrounding community. 

Anyone can pitch an API value chain automation idea at meetups. If idea is rather small, it can be implemented without any concept development. Meetups and youtube offer a growing channel to find partners and co-developers. 

One possible path for further development is to take idea to Demola Network for concept refinement. In that case idea needs a host, for example a company which is willing to explore the path. Demola teams start twice a year and each team works for about 3-4 months. After the team has finalized results, it can be implemented either as open source (preferred) or prorietary. Open source components are managed under APIOps organization in Github.

## Community funding and partner packages
All the meetup sessions are recorded and published in APIOps Youtube channel. All the videos are monetized with advertisements. The profit from video views are divided with APIOps host organization (Apinf Ltd) and APIOps community. Community gets 50% of the Youtube income and host company gets the other 50%. Host company will spend their share of the Youtube income in paying the fulltime global network manager's salary. 

**In other words, the more awesome content community creates in Youtube, the more resources it will get.** 

Received funding is used in advancing APIOps community, organize events and support local groups. 

Local groups are encouraged to seek out partners, which support group activities with various resources. One partner could for example pay food and drinks for one or more meetups. 

**Partner packages** are described in [separate page](https://github.com/APIOps/community-resources/blob/master/partner-packages.md). It is adviced that with each partner, an agreement is signed by both parties. You can use the provided agreement or if needed draft a new one. (TODO: add agreement draft to repository) 

<a name="cooperation"/>

## Co-operation - development and network scaling
APIOps Global Network aims to expand to all Demola Network locations during 2017-2018. APInf Oy (global lead of APIOps network) and Demola International have signed a co-operation agreement 1.3.2017. 

APIOps Network is open for further co-operation with other operators and platforms.  

**Companies can do open development with the community**. For example APInf Ltd uses resources to do technical and conceptual explorations. APInf uses Demola Network to discover new concepts in API management and API value chain. In some cases concepts prove to be awesome and then more resources are used with the aim to implement PoC level service. Companies can present ideas in meetups to raise community interest and test the initial response to the idea.
