# Bridging Hacklabs, Demola and industry

As part of APIOps movement we build bridges between APIs consuming and creating industries. APIs are in the core of IoT. 
Machine industry needs innovative people and hacklabs are full of free thinkers and hackers. People participating in Hacklabs
come from all segments of the society, but to be fair, most of them are middle-aged highly educated men. 
We in Apinf want to bridge hacklabs and SME machine building companies to create new innovative solutions to IoT and beyond. 
In addition we bring in the Demola Network which can be used to add service design in the process.
