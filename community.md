## Community funding and partner packages
All the meetup sessions are recorded and published in APIOps Youtube channel. All the videos are monetized with advertisements. The profit from video views are divided with APIOps host organization (Apinf Ltd) and APIOps community. Community gets 50% of the Youtube income and host company gets the other 50%. Received funding is used in advancing APIOps community, organize events and support local groups. 

Local groups are encouraged to seek out partners, which support group activities with various resources. One partner could for example pay food and drinks for one or more meetups. 

Partner packages are described in [separate page](https://github.com/APIOps/community-resources/blob/master/partner-packages.md). TODO: copy content from local drive.
